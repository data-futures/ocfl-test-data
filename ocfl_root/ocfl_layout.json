  "description" : "OCFL object identifiers are hashed and encoded as lowercase hex strings. These digests are then divided into N n-tuple segments, which are used to create nested paths under the OCFL storage root. Finally, the OCFL object identifier is percent-encoded to create a directory name for the OCFL object root."
