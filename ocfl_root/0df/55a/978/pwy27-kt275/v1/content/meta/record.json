The manuscript is a copy, probably made in Egypt in the late 12th or early 13th century, of an anonymous work compiled in the first half of the 11th century in Egypt. The treatise is extraordinarily important for the history of science, especially for astronomy and cartography, and contains an unparalleled series of diagrams of the heavens and maps of the earth. It was acquired in June 2002 by the Bodleian Library.</p>", "rights": [{"title": {"en": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International"}, "description": {"en": "The Creative Commons Attribution license allows re-distribution and re-use of a licensed work on the condition that the creator is appropriately credited."}, "props": {"url": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode", "scheme": "spdx"}, "id": "cc-by-4.0"}], "publication_date": "2021-11-17"}, "parent": {"id": "pwy27-kt275"}, "access": {"status": "open", "record": "public", "embargo": {"reason": null, "active": false}, "files": "public"}, "files": {"order": [], "enabled": true}, "revision_id": 3, "versions": {"is_latest": true, "index": 1}, "is_published": true, "id": "0k6vn-62356"}
